How It Works
Game Flow:

The game starts with a prompt: "Would you like to play Rock, Paper, Scissors?"
The user can select "Yes" to start the game or "No" to reset the game.
Once the user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, the program evaluates the winner based on classic rules:
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
Scores:

The scores for both the user and the computer are updated dynamically and displayed on the screen.
Play Again or Quit:

At the end of each round, the user is prompted to either play again or quit.
